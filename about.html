            I started the freeCodeCamp with excitement and high expectations but I ended up underestimating it.
        I relied on previous html experience in WASSCE to help me understand certain concepts. 
        There were times I didn't understand the instructions and would be stuck on a step for the whole day. 
        To solve this I would take I would take a break from it reorient myself and get back into.
        In freeCodeCamp I learnt the basic format of in creating a website (Doctype, html, head, body).
        I also came to understand the difference between a tag and an element.
        I learnt the types of elements we have and their unique attributes and the values you can assign to them.
        Alongside HTML, I also learnt CSS which allows you to edit and assign styles or fornats to HTML elements and classes.
        I also learnt about div elements and classes.
